#'Report the energy intensity per  p/tkm
#'
#'Dividing the energy intensity per veh km by the
#'load factor gives it per unit of energy service.
#'Passenger and freight share one variable name and receive the unit of their sector (MJ/pkm,
#'MJ/tkm). On the aggregation levels that both sectors share (e.g. |Transport|Road) the unit
#'collapses to MJ/(p|t)km, as aggregateVariables() does it for the energy service and the costs.
#'The energy intensity per energy service is calculated for all modes, so that the energy service
#'weighted aggregation of every level is correct. Which of the resulting variables are reported is
#'configured in helpersReportingEnergyIntensityPerES.csv.
#'
#' @param fleetEnergyIntensity Energy intensity linked to the vehicle fleet in MJ/vehkm
#' @param loadFactor Persons or tons per vehicle
#' @param helpers List of helpers
#'
#' @returns Energy intensity per p/tkm on fleet level
